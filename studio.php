    <p>Hello to each and every soul who visits our iYoga Studio. Our Studio was founded by a certified yoga teacher Irina Lungu in 2020. 
        The studio includes all the props you need to have a nice and heartwarming practice. All our yoga equipment is biodegradable, 
        sustainable and eco-friendly. All equipment was provided by our very trusted sponsor YogaTools. Our studio includes enough space 
        to accomodate sessions with under 15 participants. We provide every single visitor and student with accessories like cork eco-friendly 
        yoga mats, bolsters made of organic sustainable cotton, cork yoga blocks and bricks of all shapes and sizes, blankets, linseed sandbag eye masks,
        yoga belts and zafus. All yoga equipment sets are color matched, so whenever you are coming to one of our lessons you are free to choose the color
        set you love the most. We ensure that every single class will give you a feeling of warmth, comfort and happiness.</p>
